<h1> To Do List </h1>

<strong>Description:</strong> A very simple application that simulates a To-Do List. Users can add items to the list, and they will automatically
be displayed in the list. Upon completing the tasks, the user checks the box to remove the item, and the item is immediately
removed. Note: This is a very simple application, as mentioned earlier; there is no database interaction and no CRUD operations performed in this project, it's just a way for me to practice learning Angular 6. 

<strong>Installation:</strong> To use this application, you must have Angular 6 or later installed on your local machine.

<strong>Usage:</strong> A simple application that lets users create and update a to-do list
